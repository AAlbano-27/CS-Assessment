              <h3>I feel like something is different</h3>
              <h3>The style I'm wearing is a little different, maybe that is it</h3>
              <h3>Maybe it's the sky today? No, it's looks the same</h3>
              <h3>Could it be the birds? No, still noisy as ever</h3>
              <h3>But there is still something...</h3>
              <h3>Something I can't figure out</h3>
              <h3>It's starting to bother me now</h3>
              <h3>Could there be something missing?</h3>
              <h3>Was the fish pond missing a fish? No, it's still there</h3>
              <h3>The play park is a little quiet, Nope still noisy</h3>
              <h3>The gate seems to be missing the long like that is usually there</h3>
              <h3>OH WAIT! I'm missing my I.D.!</h3>
